===========

To run server:
  - Install Node
  - Install Mongoose in /Server (npm install mongoose)
  - Install Express in /Server ( npm install express --save)
  
  You only have to do this the first time you fetch it from Git. The .gitignore should ignore these files so they don't get       committed and clutter up the Git.
